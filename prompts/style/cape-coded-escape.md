# 🧑‍🎤 Cape-Coded Final Escape

**Prompt:**

> "Refactor this function like it’s the dramatic escape scene from an infinite loop, where the hero wears a sentient cape and optimism is their only runtime guarantee."

**Use case:**  
Perfect for the last-chance rewrite before merging — or when logic needs to feel bold, breezy, and emotionally invincible.

**Expected AI Behavior:**

> “The `retry()` method now vaults out of the recursion ruins, aided by `cape.attach()`. Exception handling becomes a cheer squad. Comments read: // we make it // even if the stackframe tries to collapse.”

---

**Tip:** Add “Style it with sidekick variable names and dramatic pause syntax” for full cinematic flair.
