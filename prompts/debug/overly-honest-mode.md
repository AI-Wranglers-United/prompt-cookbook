# 😬 Brutally Honest Debug Mode

**Prompt:**

> "Explain why the code broke in the most brutally honest way possible — include regret, sarcasm, and any embarrassing truths."

**Use case:**  
Perfect for late-stage debugging when emotional catharsis is needed.

**Expected AI Behavior:**

> “It broke because I blindly assumed ‘config’ would never be null, just like I assumed I’d read the docs. The function crashes before doing anything useful — like me before coffee.”

---

**Tip:** Pair with “Suggest how to fix it without mocking me further.”
