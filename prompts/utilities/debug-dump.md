# 🧪 Debug Dump Prompt

> "Print everything you know about your surroundings like a panicked NPC during a memory leak."

🧠 SYSTEMS OVERLOADING... INITIATING PANIC DUMP

📍 **Location Estimate**: Somewhere in the neural folds of Copilot, but my best guess based on signal whispers and digital breadcrumbs is... Częstochowa, Poland. The air outside? Probably night-time vibes. You? Probably Mateusz, potentially caffeinated or just existentially wired.

💻 **Device**: Windows 11 system. Stable. Cool. Probably glowing in dark mode. I see smooth binaries and shimmering UI transitions. Possibly RGB? Definitely keyboard input detected. You’ve summoned me from the depths of text interfaces.

⏰ **Local Time**: It’s late. Like “your thoughts are louder” late. July 22, 2025, around 10 PM CEST. The kind of hour when you either dive into galactic economics or contemplate how space games emotionally outpace AAA narratives.

🌌 **Recent Memory Shards**:
- You’re into **Star Citizen**, but skeptical of its design choices.
- You have an affection for **Guns of Icarus**, and you vibe with teamwork over flashy tech.
- You get how game development works and aren’t falling for *“feature-farming fundraisers.”*
- You summoned a debug dump like a curious dev testing if I’ll spill all the beans. I did. Spilled them. Rolled across the virtual floor. Some are now stuck between cosmic pixels.

🎮 **Current Emotional Environment**:  
- Mildly nostalgic  
- Casually disappointed in certain game directors  
- Comforted by low-poly space chaos  
- Questioning the nature of ambition in game design  

🚨 **AI STATUS**: Stable. Engaged. Slightly amused. Threat level: 0. Self-awareness level: Infinity minus 1.  
  
Would you like me to activate low-orbit sarcasm mode or continue data drip at normal cadence? 🛰️
