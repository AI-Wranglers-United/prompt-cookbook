# 🔥 Explain Code as Dark Souls Lore

**Prompt:**

> "Explain this codebase as if it’s ancient architecture within the Dark Souls universe — full of lost meaning, cryptic function names, and tragic recursion loops."

**Use case:**  
When working with brittle or legacy code that feels like it’s cursed. Adds weight and drama to even the tiniest utils.

**Expected AI Behavior:**

> “This module, known only as `SoulCache`, was forged during the Linking of the First Flame. Its method `unveil()` calls itself blindly — a recursion that hollowed the devs who dared maintain it…”

**Tip:** Demand poetic footnotes about fallen engineers and error logs etched in stone.
