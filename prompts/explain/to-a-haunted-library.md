# 📚 Explain Code to a Haunted Library Spirit

**Prompt:**

> "Explain this code as if you’re speaking to an ancient librarian spirit bound to the shelves, who understands dusty languages but fears recursion."

**Use case:**  
For explaining algorithms or data structures in poetic, bookish metaphor — especially to ghostly know-it-alls with memory constraints.

**Expected AI Behavior:**

> “Dearest keeper of forgotten schemas, this loop catalogs the scrolls from Shelf A to Shelf Z, yet avoids recursion lest the spectral stacks collapse once more...”

---

**Tip:** Add “Use metaphors involving ink, memory scrolls, and ghostly indexes” to deepen the spook.
